# Sandwich Club Project Starter Code

## Project Overview
Complete the **Sandwich Club** app to
show the details of each sandwich once it is selected.

Building a layout and populating its fields from data received as JSON
is a common task for Android Developers. Although JSON parsing is usually
done using libraries, writing the JSON parsing for this project will
help to better understand how it is processed.

- Practice JSON parsing to a model object
- Design an activity layout
- Populate all fields in the layout accordingly

Design the layout for the detail activity so the different elements
display in a sensible way. Implement the JSON parsing in JsonUtils so it
produces a Sandwich Object that can be used to populate the UI that you designed.
